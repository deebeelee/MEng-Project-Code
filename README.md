DB Lee: Data-Driven Air Quality Modeling

Our project team aims to model pollutant concentrations in global cities and attribute them to urban features in a quantitative manner. My task in particular is to model the expected pollution due to traffic in London, UK.
In particular, we analyze a publicly available traffic dataset from the Department for Traffic, UK, and attempt to build an hourly traffic model. This model will be an input to a larger air quality model whose goal is to predict the air quality at a specific location and time.
